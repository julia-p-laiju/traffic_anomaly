# traffic_anomaly
Hey everyone, this is my project on traffic anomaly detection using deep learnin models. This project uses YOLOv5, OpenCV, and Flask to create a real-time traffic incident detection system. The system processes video feeds to detect traffic incidents and sends alert notifications via email. The project includes a simple dashboard for monitoring and visualization.

Key Features:
1. Real-time detection of traffic incidents using YOLOv5.
2. Integration of OpenCV for video processing.
3. Flask-based web dashboard for visualization.
4. Email alert notifications for detected incidents.

(Ps- code availabe in master branch)
